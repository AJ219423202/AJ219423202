**Situation:**  
As part of the Interview Skills module, I engaged in a mock interview to experience the formal interview environment and evaluate how well I could present my skills, knowledge, and personality under pressure.  

**Task:**  
My goal was to demonstrate professionalism by maintaining good posture, clear communication, and confident body language.

**Action:**  
I prepared by researching common interview questions, practicing verbal and non-verbal communication, and reviewing my resume to align my responses with relevant examples. During the mock session, I focused on active listening, maintaining eye contact, and delivering concise, well-structured answers that reflected my problem-solving and teamwork abilities.  

**Result:**  
This mock interview experience significantly boosted my confidence and improved my ability to communicate clearly and professionally. I gained practical feedback on areas such as tone, pacing, and response structure, which I have since applied to refine my interview performance. Overall, the exercise strengthened my readiness for real interviews and enhanced my professional presentation skills.
